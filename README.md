# Keyboard layout for Windows - English (intl., with AltGr dead keys)

The layout called United States-International, included by default in Windows, allows to write many non-ASCII characters via a keyboard with a US QWERTY layout. It is very useful for many languages based on the Latin script.

This layout takes some keys from the QWERTY keyboard and changes them into "dead keys" such as:
- the grave accent `` ` ``
- the tilde `~`
- the apostrophe `'`
- the double quotes `"`

To enter these characters, you must type these keys followed by a space. Other characters are available by using AltGr as a dead key.

This behavior can be arduous in some cases, especially if you don't need the non-ASCII characters that are entered using these dead keys, especially since it deviates from the basic US QWERTY.

This repository takes the default behavior of the US QWERTY by allowing access to the dead keys via the combination with the AltGr key. It is mainly inspired by the US keymap in the `altgr-intl` variant of X11. The layout file can be opened with the Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC) tool.
